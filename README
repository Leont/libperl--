Libperl++

This is libperl++. A library for embedding and extending perl in C++.

DEPENDENCIES
The library should work on perl 5.8.1 or higher, though 5.10 is recommended. A
recent C++ compiler is required (GCC 4.4 or higher or (in the near future)
MSVC++ 2010). Also, some Boost headers are required to build it, but there are
no dependencies on Boost runtime libraries.

ISSUES

Building libperl++ on Windows currently doesn't work due to issues in Perl's
linking toolchain. This is being worked on.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
