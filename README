Libperl++

This is libperl++. A library for embedding and extending perl in C++.

DEPENDENCIES
The library should work on perl 5.8.1 or higher, though 5.10 is recommended. A
recent C++ compiler is required (I recommend the most recent version you can
get). Also, some Boost headers are required to build it, but there are no
dependencies on Boost runtime libraries.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
