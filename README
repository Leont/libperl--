Libperl++

This is the beginning of libperl++. Almost all functions for accessing perl from
C++ are finished, and should be beta quality. However, the functionality to export C++
functions, methods and variables to perl are alpha quality. 

DEPENDENCIES
The library should work on perl 5.8.1 or higher. Also, some Boost headers are
required to build it, but there are no dependencies on Boost runtime libraries.

BUILDING
It can be build using a simple `make`. This build the shared library
(libperl++.so).

TESTING
You can run tests by typing `make test`. If you want the full output, you can run `VERBOSE=1 make test`

INSTALLATION
I don't really recommend doing that in this stage, but `make install` is
available.
