Libperl++

This is the beginning of libperl++. Almost all functions for accessing perl from
C++ are finished, and should be beta quality. However, the functionality to export C++
functions, methods and variables to perl are alpha quality. 

DEPENDENCIES
The library should work on perl 5.8.1 or higher. It may work on lower versions,
but that isn't tried. Also, some Boost headers are required to build it, but
there are no dependencies on Boost runtime libraries.

BUILDING
It can be build using a simple `make`. This currently build the shared library
(libperl++.so) and an example application (example). 

TESTING
There is no automated testing yet. I consider this my #1 bug.

INSTALLATION
I don't really recommend doing that in this stage, but `make install` is
availible.
