TODO (more or less in order of urgency)

Add more documentation
*Add unit testing*
  - To do this a TAP library for C++ is needed
Test for memory leaks
Replacing make with something else like Module::Build
Integration of PerlIO & IOstreams
 - Currently weird things might happen if iostreams or PerlIO doesn't use stdio
Add proper regexp support.
