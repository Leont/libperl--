=head1 BUILDING

libperl++'s build process is Build.PL compatible. All actions take options in the form C<options=value>, though if no value is given 1 is assumed.

=head2 Creating the Build executable

The Build executable can be generated by issuing

 perl Build.PL

Any options given to it will be saved and passed on to all subsequent calls of Build. Most options for Build actions are specific for that action, except C<silent>, which is used by almost all Build actions. The default is 0.

=head2 Building the library

 ./Build

it does not take any specific options.

=head2 Running tests

 ./Build test

The amount of information given depends on the value of C<silent>. It can take values from -1 to 3, from printing out individual tests to printing out nothing.

=head2 Installing the library

 ./Build install

Install can take a number of options
