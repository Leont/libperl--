libperl++ - Tutorial

=head1 VERSION

XXX

=head1 INSTALLATION

Currently the recommended way to get libperl++ is to checkout the latest version from git at L<git://github.com/Leont/libperl--.git>. Releases are currently uncommon. It can be installed using plain old make: a more portable solution is being planned.

=head1 GETTING STARTED

libperl++ is a library for embedding perl. In this tutorial I'm taking simple imaginary game and expose the C++ and perl sides to each other. First of all, we need an interpreter object. For this simple game, we'll use a global interpreter:

	static Interpreter universe;

Using the interpreter we can access perl variables and functions.
