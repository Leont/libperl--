TODO (more or less in order of urgency)

*Add unit testing*
  - Implement TAP library for C++
Add documentation
Replacing make with Module::Build
Make perl++ a shared library
 - Currently it builds a static library because IMO that's easier during development. This shouldn't be done in production use
Test for memory leaks
Integration of PerlIO & IOstreams
 - Currently weird things might happen if iostreams or perl doesn't use stdio
